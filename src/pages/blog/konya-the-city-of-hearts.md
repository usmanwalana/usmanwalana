This is why you are in Konya. Take out some time and let all the spirtual vibes sink in. Spend 20 Lira and you will get a mobile with multiligual description of items and their history. You spend so much to get here so it is better that you get knowledge of all the items. You will find different Qurans written by hand. Offer your prayers and pray to Allah.
